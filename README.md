# Automated AWS Receipt Processing System

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Overview of Project

This project focuses on automating receipt processing using AWS services.  
Instead of manually handling receipts‚Äîwhich can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale‚Äîthis system extracts structured data from receipts and stores it efficiently for record-keeping and auditing.

The architecture consists of:

- **Storage Layer**: Amazon S3 stores receipt images and PDFs.  
- **Processing Layer**: Amazon Textract extracts text from receipts using AI-powered OCR.  
- **Database Layer**: DynamoDB stores the extracted data in a structured format.  
- **Notification System**: Amazon SES sends email alerts with receipt details.  
- **Compute Layer**: AWS Lambda automates the workflow by processing the receipts in real-time.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Steps to be Performed

1. **Storage and Database Setup**:  
   Create an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

2. **Notification Setup**:  
   Configure Amazon SES for email alerts.

3. **Processing Setup**:  
   Create a Lambda function to handle receipt processing.

4. **Integration and Testing**:  
   Tie everything together and run tests to validate.

## üóëÔ∏è Clean-Up (so that no charges are incurred due to prolonged use of AWS resources)

1. **Delete S3 Bucket**  
   Remove all uploaded receipt files, then delete the bucket.

2. **Stop Textract Processing**  
   Ensure no further API calls are made to avoid extra costs.

3. **Delete DynamoDB Table**  
   Remove stored receipt data, then delete the table.

4. **Disable SES Notifications**  
   Remove verified email addresses if SES was configured.

5. **Remove IAM Roles and Policies**  
   Delete the IAM role created for the Lambda function.
